To install my code you should be able to use

python setup.py install

on windows or 

sudo python setup.py install

on Ubuntu.

I had to use a trick to get the system to find wiiuse.so on the path
on Gutsy. Download and build wiiuse. Then

sudo cp wiiuse.so /usr/local/lib/libwiiuse.so.1.0
cd /usr/local/lib
sudo ln -s libwiiuse.so.1.0 libwiiuse.so.1
sudo ln -s libwiiuse.so.1 libwiiuse.so
sudo ldconfig

On Windows putting wiiuse.dll anywhere on your path should work. 

On Windows you have to "join" your wiimote to the system before you
can use it. I don't know why this is necessary and it sure is a
bother. I seem to have to do it every time I boot Windows.
Here is how I do it. 

1. Open the Control Panel "Bluetooth" applet.
2. Click Add
3. Check the box that says My device is up and ready to be found.
4. Press and hold buttons 1&2 on the wiimote. Hold them till the process is entirely finished.
5. Click Next
6. The flashlight icon will appear as it searches for the device.
7. Nitendo RVL-CNT-01 (or something like that will appear), click on that and hit next.
8. It will say adding device or some such.
9. Click finish.
