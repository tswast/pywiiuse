PyWiiuse
========

This project is a Python wrapper for the Wiiuse Wii remote library. This has been updated to keep up with the semi-official port at https://github.com/rpavlik/wiiuse and http://www.vrac.iastate.edu/vancegroup/docs/wiiuse/


It uses ctypes, so it should work with the official CPython or PyPy.
